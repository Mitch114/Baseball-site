    <h2>Baseball, in review</h2>
    We play it as kids, we watch it and listen
     to it as adults, and we pass down our love of the Game through generations.
     Baseball is an American family tradition. Often referred to as America's National Pastime,
     baseball has had a very active role in the shaping of this nation. Throughout history, baseball 
     has not only entertained, but has also offered a sense of comfort during difficult times.
